A Reddit clone using TypeScript, NextJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Tailwind CSS and user avatars from the DiceBear API.

Users can sign in with their Reddit account and post to a particular subreddit (or subreadit, in this case). If their specified subreadit doesn't yet exist, it will be created.

They can also leave comments on posts as well as give upvotes and downvotes.

With more time, I would have liked to put the nav bar's home dropdown, search bar and menu icon to use. As things are, they're just there to replicate Reddit's UI.
